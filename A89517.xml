         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That is the reaſon that the elect of God do not ariſe to their full reward before the reſurrection of all fleſh, becauſe their works do follow them in order as they are done, and their light goeth not out by night, Death doth not quench their candle.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Is, Lawfull calling. We read of no true Prophet but he had a miſſion, as before.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.5.</note> Chriſt took not this honour upon him to be the great Angel of the Covenant, but was ſent by his Father.</p>
               <p>But falſe Prophets run and are not ſent, God ſendeth none ſuch on his errands into his Church.</p>
               <p>But this is not ſo eaſily diſcovered, becauſe none do make more ſhew of lawfull calling then the falſe Prophets do.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>edification</hi> is building up of the Church of God; falſe Prophets ſeek the pulling down of Gods Church, and the divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men from all good wayes, they ſeek to hinder the courſe of the Goſpel, and to diſcourage the hearts of them that feare God.</p>
               <p>Here a falſe Prophet may have a true prophecie tending to the good of the Church, and the prophecie is to be received, and the Prophet refuſed,<note place="margin">John 11 50</note> as <hi>Caiphas</hi> prophecied; <hi>Expedit ut unus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatur,</hi> it is meet one dye; and <hi>Balaam</hi> prophecied truly, yet was he a falſe Prophet.</p>

By obſerving the aime and end of theſe Prophets: for ſuch as prophecie aright, do ſay with Chriſt, <hi>non quaero gloriam meam,</hi> I ſeek not my own glory; But falſe Prophets ſeek either filthy gain, or they ſeek their own vain glory; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They ſeek not,</hi>

                  <hi>if the thing follow not, nor come to paſſe, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the name of a viſion given to propheſie doth declare the certainty of the event; for it is a thing ſo revealed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as if he ſaw it with his eye.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The perſons of the prophets and their carriage doth detect them: for if they be men ſanctified, aad fitted with eminent graces for that ſervice, the graces of God do teſtifie of them: for God doth ſend none, but with all fit preparations for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo great an office.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This title of viſion doth give us aſſurance of all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in this prophecie; for God revealed it, and the prophet ſaw it.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſo many of you as deſire to receive any good from the interpretation of this prophecie, remember that it is a viſion and therefore bring your eyes with you to this place, not the eyes of your body only, but the ſpirituall eyes of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and pray with David, <hi>

               <p>From this naturall Antipathy between theſe two brethren, and the grudge that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger;</p>
               <p>From the ſentence of this difference, which was, I <hi>have loved Jacob, and</hi> I <hi>have hated Eſau:</hi> there was ever mutuall war and hatred between <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Edom:</hi> in their ſucceeding poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for the poſterity of <hi>Eſau</hi> did encreaſe both in number and wealth and grew both many and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>Thus doth the world gather riches and ſtrength and armeth it ſelf againſt the Church of God, and therefore the Church is called <hi>Militant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Edom</hi> is this part of the Prophecie, declaring both Gods quarrell againſt them, and his judgement threatened.</p>
               <p>We may take notice here of one point by the way, <hi>Edom</hi> is a mighty people, a ſtrong and rich nation, able to moleſt the Lords <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God from heaven undertaketh the quarrell of his Church.</p>
               <p>Do you not ſee that they whom God hates may have riches and honour and ſtrength, and may encreaſe, and grow into multitudes? how cometh it then to paſſe that ſo many in the world do meaſure the love and favour of God by theſe outward things, as one flattered his Prince?</p>

               <p>Outward things are the gifts of God, and he doth not value them at ſo high a rate as we do; He doth not care if his enemies have them.</p>
               <p>His own Son when he took upon him our fleſh, had none of them more then for neceſſity; and his Apoſtle perſwadeth us, if we have food and raiment to be therewith content.</p>
               <p>For there be ſnares in theſe outward things, and if God give not a bleſſing with them, they be the rods of God to ſcourge the ſons of men, and great impediments to godly life.</p>

               <p>There is nothing that giveth faith firm footing but the word of God.</p>

               <p>Sin is folly, ſinners are fools; bray a fool in a mortar, yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him; therefore they are under the rods and ſcorpions of wrath, and cannot avoid the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the faithfulneſſe of his Prophets, for the Prophets of the Lord that threaten theſe judgements from his mouth ſhall not be found liars: ſeeing their Prophecies are no ſelf-given no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but inſpirations of his ſpirit, which is the Spirit of truth.</p>
               <p>You know how <hi>Jonah</hi> was troubled to be a meſſenger of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> when he was perſwaded that God would ſhew them mercy, and ſo his Prophecie fall to the ground: he could rather have looked on to ſee the utter deſtruction of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> then that his Prophecie ſhould be found unperformed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went another way at firſt, &amp; would not come to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> &amp; when he had propheſied, he went out of the city, &amp; there expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the event of his Prophecie; &amp; was angry that it ſucceeded not.</p>

                  <hi>Quer.</hi> We finde that in that example God changed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him of the evil which he had threatened againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> how then do we ſay, that the judgements of God againſt the wicked be unreverſable?</p>

                     </gap>h 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>that they turned from their evil way,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117695:14"/>and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them: and he did it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this we anſwer, That Gods repentance was no change of his minde, or any alteration of his counſell or decree, but a deferring of the execution of his judgement.</p>
               <p>The change was in <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and the repentance was in them; they humbled themſelves before God, and they both did the works of mortification, and they alſo beleeved God:<note place="margin">Cap. 3.5.</note> this was not a juſtifying faith, which is <hi>Credere in Deum;</hi> to beleeve in God, but an hiſtoricall, which is <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> to beleeve God.</p>
               <p>And God would have his Church ſee; that if <hi>Ahab</hi> humble himſelf, and go in ſackcloth; if <hi>Nineveh</hi> give over evil works, and repent them of their ſins, he will turn from the fierceneſſe of his wrath, all to encourage repentance. But <hi>Jonah</hi> was a true Prophet of Gods judgement, their repentance was not <hi>poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia non poenitenda,</hi> a repentance not to be repented of: for they reſumed their evil wayes: and <hi>Nahum</hi> doth renew the threatenings of <hi>Jonah,</hi> and declareth the Lords judgements againſt <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the repentance of the wicked is but for a ſeaſon, and as it is temporary, ſo it removeth judgement for a time; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their ſins, he returneth alſo to the execution of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended puniſhment.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Ahab</hi> was forborn for a time upon his humiliation, but he eſcaped not the hand of judgement: for God cannot lie.</p>
               <p>His Prophets ſpeak ſure words, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We have a more ſure word of Prophecie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Abrahams</hi> plea doth clear this point; for upon the firſt notice from God, of his intended judgement, he pleadeth for <hi>Sodom,</hi> not to turn away the wrath from the ungodly there: but he ſaith, <hi>Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the righteous with the wicked? &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>That is the moſt effectual manner of praying, even that which the Holy Ghoſt uſeth in us, with ſighs and groans: <hi>Plus fletu quam afflain.</hi> Thus when <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw <hi>Iſhmael</hi> caſt out for a ſcorner and perſecutour of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet he prayed, <hi>O that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight.</hi> And God ſaid, I <hi>have heard thee alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, ſomewhat is obtained.</hi> Therefore let us ſtill be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all men.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially ſeeing God doth not make us of his counſell ſo far as to declare to us whom he accepteth, and whom he rejecteth.</p>
               <p>From this leſſon of the certainty of the judgements of God upon the wicked, certain, whether we conſider the nature of God without change, or the weakneſſe of man without any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of reſiſting; or the nature of the reprobate without any ability of repenting, We are taught,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To reſt in the decree of God; let us know, that he cannot deny himſelf; and therefore though wrath go not out from the Lord preſently, and although his judgement is delayed, yet let us reſolve that upon the wicked he will rain ſnares, and he will break the impenitent with rods of iron.</p>

               <p>Therefore let every man in hearing and reading of the word of God, obſerve his owne ſins, how they are threatned, and let him know that he hath no way nor means but by his ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to eſcape that judgment.</p>

                  <item>1.

                  <item>3.

               <p>To deny Chriſt in judgment, which obſtinacie is againſt the foundation, and maketh a Chriſtian no Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>To deny Chriſt in fact only, ſheweth us to be weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in our profeſſion of the Goſpel; and the beſt of Gods ſervants cannot keep out of this ranck, becauſe it is impoſſible for them that carry a body of ſinne, who do the evill that they would not, to hold conformity of life and converſation with their knowledge and good deſires.</p>
               <p>And truly the authors or the actors of chiſme, do ſhew much uncharitableneſſe in their ſeparation from our Church; for the Apoſtles rule is, <hi>Be not unequally yoked with Infidels: What concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi>

                  <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and ſeparate your ſelves, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And do they judge their brethren to be Infidels, the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Idolaters, that they do ſeparate from us?</p>
               <p>Againe, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to the wholſome words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim 6, 3.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Can any lay this to the charge of our Church, that we offend in this kind? It is true, that nothing is more eaſie then to accuſe, but men and Devils cannot prove this againſt our Church.</p>
               <p>The Church of the Jewes in the times immediately after Chriſts Aſcenſion was the Church of God; neither did Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that Church in his time, nor the Apoſtles after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when certaine men heardened and diſobeyed,</hi>

               <p>Therefore <hi>ariſe</hi> againſt ſuch in battell, detect them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authority ſeek their amendment, or if that cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, proſecute the ridding them out of the Church, for thoſe Edomites do not love the welfare of our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and they will not know thoſe things which belong to peace, <hi>The way of peace they have not known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the name and title of <hi>Edom,</hi> we may underſtand the whole Kingdome of Satan; and <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Church of God ſtirred up by the embaſſadours, the Miniſters of God, <hi>to ariſe againſt it in battell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this, is our life called a Warfare, becauſe we fight againſt Satan the profeſſed enemy of the Church, &amp; againſt all his forces.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>And his inward forces. <hi>Corpus peccati,</hi> the body of ſin.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knowing the danger of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, doth not only awake us to fight, and giveth us his owne example, <hi>ſo fighting not as one beateth the aire:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he preſcribeth us to a fit armour,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.19. &amp;c.</note> and teacheth us how to put it on, that we may be able to defend our ſelves, and to reſiſt Satan.</p>
               <p>This is no power of our own, but our ſtrength in the Lord, <hi>and in the power of his might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore to will is preſent with us, but we are not able to do to good that we would;</hi> yea, he confeſſeth that he <hi>cannot do the good that he would, and that he doeth the evill that he would not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpirit of God is Gods Embaſſadour, calling upon our ſpirits to ariſe againſt the fleſh in battell; and that is the true
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117695:31"/>uſe of all Doctrines of mortification, and of godly life, to ſtrengthen the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, to weaken the power of the body of ſin. And for this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did bring his body in ſubjection; for ſuch is the nature of this fight, that the more we reſiſt our naturall and ſenſuall deſires, the more we advance the force of our ſpirits againſt our fleſh.</p>
               <p>And it a moſt glorious conqueſt for any ſervant of God to overcome himſelf.</p>

               <p>Let no man meaſure the favours of God by the acceſſe of his poſſeſſion, by the territories of his dominion, by the multitude of his men, by the force of his ſtrength: God gave all theſe things to <hi>Eſau</hi> whom he hated.</p>
               <p>Rather let men fortunate and proſperous in their wayes, who have the deſires of their hearts ſatisfied, and whoſe paths be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with butter, ſuſpect that God hath ſet them in ſlippery places. <hi>Vivunt inter laquies.</hi>

               <p>Let them know that their fulneſſe doth come of Gods open hand, <hi>aperit &amp; implet:</hi> and let them know that <hi>The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away,</hi> and therefore let them take out both Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> leſſons:</p>

                  <hi>I have learned how to abound, and how to want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are not to ſeek in our own times of examples of ſmalnes turned into greatneſſe, and of greatneſſe again made ſmall.</p>
               <p>It is a judgment that <hi>David</hi> complained of, <hi>Thou haſt lifted me up, and caſt me downe:</hi> how much more peace have they in their boſomes, that were ever ſmall, then they who having riſen above others, are ſtooped beneath themſelves, and laid ſo low, that the foot of pride treadeth on them: down ſtout heart; there is no perpetuity in things temporall.</p>
               <p>Great <hi>Edom</hi> is made ſmall, rough and boyſterous <hi>Edom,</hi> that carries all by ſtrong hand, is made meek and tame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Made ſmall amongſt the Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were numbred among the Heathen, and amongſt them they were great, they ſeparated from the Church of God, like the ſons of ſober and religious parents that turne gallants and roarers; and amongſt theſe they ſhine awhile; amongſt theſe <hi>Edom</hi> was made ſmall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> had an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> that was caſt out among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:117695:34"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> had an <hi>Eſau</hi> that put himſelf in amongſt them; all the ſons of <hi>Iacob</hi> were Patriarches, great Fathers of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſau,</hi> where he roſe to glory and greatneſſe, there he ſunk into ſmalneſſe; the eyes that ſaw him in his ſhining, ſaw him eclipſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath done this; there be few that look ſo high when they are down, but they do rather complain of evill fortune, or of ſome great wrong done to them here below, failing of means, diſertion of friends, or injuſtice in ſuperiours. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then look to ſecond cauſes, and to naturall agents, they conſider not that it is God <hi>who lifteth up, and caſteth down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God taketh it upon himſelf, and would have <hi>Edom</hi> know that this is <hi>Dextra Iehovae,</hi> the right hand of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Others look high at firſt, and upon every degree of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, do charge God with hard meaſure, and murmure at his uneven hand, as if he had not done them right; which as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, is to <hi>charge God fooliſhly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let men take it how they will, God is the Author of the riſing and falling of the ſons of men, of their growth and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering; can God hate, and his hatred ſit idle and look on? as his love is operative, ſo is his hatred: ſuch is his love, that all things work together for the beſt to them whom he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> addeth, <hi>etiam peccata,</hi> even their ſins; another, <hi>etiam adverſa</hi> their adverſary; and ſuch is his hatred that all things work contrary to the ruine of them whom he hateth; <hi>etiam proſperitas,</hi> even their proſperity, <hi>for the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fools doth destroy them.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Deſpiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The children of <hi>Edom</hi> had two great temptations to ſwell them, that is riches and power; theſe they inſolently abuſed, to oppreſſion of their neighbours. God, who <hi>powreth contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117695:34"/>Princes,</hi> covered them with contempt: This is the ſevereſt vengeance that pride feareth; <hi>Edom</hi> that was higheſt and bore rule over the Nations, and lived by the ſword, is now made <hi>ſmall;</hi> after this fall followeth contempt.</p>
               <p>God hath ſaid it, <hi>They that deſpiſe me, ſhall be deſpiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deſpiſed greatly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride will have a fall,</hi> it never falleth lower here on earth, then when it falleth into great contempt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of God, that he turneth away from them, or ſetteth his face againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of man, and that</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Prophets of the Lord do ſet their faces againſt them, as in this caſe.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>&amp; prophecie againſt it;</hi> it is no ſmall matter to have the Meſſengers of God againſt us, which do carry his ſure word of prophecie; for they ſpeak from the mouth of the Lord, and where they denounce the judgment of God againſt impenitent ſinners, <hi>whoſoevers ſinnes they retaine, they are retained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Lord hath expreſſed his hatred, and pronounced his judgment, the Church of God deſpiſeth their power, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideth their malice, ſaying, <hi>Thou O God ſeeſt it, for thou beholdeſt ungodlineſſe and wrong to take the matter into thy hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This maketh it a great and full contempt, when they that ſerved them, ſhall be Lords over them, and their ſword can no longer help them; ſo is <hi>Edom</hi> deſpiſed among the Heathen; this is great contempt to have the contempt of God and man.</p>

               <p>This vice oppoſeth God, and tranſgreſſeth and treſpaſſeth the Majeſty of God; it began to all the other ſins, it infected glorious Angels, and turned them into Devils.</p>
               <p>One obſerveth that pride is no Recuſant, it will come to Church; a man that lives in the light of Religion, and hath any morall goodneſſe in him, will lay down his covetouſneſſe, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, luxury, idleneſſe, envy, anger, for Service time; but the proud perſon will bring pride to Church along with him: <hi>Two men went up to the Temple to pray, one a proud Phariſee.</hi>

               <p>Learning unſanctified, and the very knowledge of Religion doth breed pride, and that maketh contention, for pride is the root of Schiſme and Hereſie.</p>

               <p>We acknowledge God powerfull in his own Ordinance; we hold that the Grace given to the Elect in Baptiſm is ſealed and imprinteth an indelible character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confirmation</hi> is no more but a watering of the Plants which the ordinance of God hath graſſed. <hi>Penance</hi> is no more but a ſtirring up of the grace given in baptiſm: <hi>extreme unction</hi> is of no neceſſity, it was a temporall practiſe in thoſe times when the gift of healing was in the Church; inſtead whereof we have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both in private and in publike Congregations. The Grace of Baptiſm we hold ſufficient for the whole life to ſanctifie it, and in the Elect of God it is not, it cannot be loſt.</p>
               <p>The true Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation</hi> is the Lords Supper, for that repreſenteth to us the body that was broken for us, and the blood that clenſeth us from all our ſins; that is often repeated to call us to repentance and to ſtrengthen our Faith.</p>
               <p>If we flatter our ſelves, that the act of receiving doth ſanctifie us, that is a deceiving of our own hearts; for <hi>the fleſh profiteth nothing, it is the ſpirit that quickeneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know that it may be eaten to condemnation; if there were carnall preſence of Chriſt, none could eat of it but he muſt be joyned ſo with Chriſt as he could not periſh.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the Sacrament of <hi>orders,</hi> they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the pride of their hearts, thinking that God hath given them the Kingdome of Grace, and of glory to beſtow where they will.</p>
               <p>We are the Miniſters of God, ſent forth as Gods Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117695:40"/>to carry his pardon to ſuch as are penitent: the pardon doth ſet forth who are capable of it; we are the Miniſters of God to make tender of the means of Grace to ſuch as are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them.</p>

               <p>Humility deals truly with us: for it I be humble, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that I have, and think it more then I deſerve.</p>
               <p>I do not envy either greater graces in others, or higher places; for I know mine own weck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well may an humble man ſuffer from others, but he will keep ſo good a watch upon his own heart, that that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceive him by any information of ſelf-wiſdome.</p>
               <p>But I commend a Virtue that but half keeps a living man in the earth, ſaith the gallant; true, but as the root is deep em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſomed of the earth which makes the Free bear a ſtorm the better.</p>
               <p>But this keepeth men from putting forth themſelves, where they may exerciſe their other virtues. I but it joyeth all well-affected, that Church and Common wealth aboundeth ſo in choyce, that there is no need of me.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This opinion of the ſtrength of an impregnable habitation hath deceived many.</p>
               <p>After <hi>David</hi> had reigned ſeven yeeres in <hi>Hebron, The King and his men went to Jeruſalem to the Jebuſites the inhabitants of the land,</hi>

                  <hi>which ſpake unto David ſaying, except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou ſhalt not come in thither, Thinking David cannot come hither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hebrewes have made a figurative conſtruction of theſe words, namely that the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> did preſerve two Images, the one of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was blind, the other of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was lame, theſe two <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> made a Covenant with <hi>Abimilech,</hi> in which League they comprehended the <hi>Iebuſites;</hi> therefore the league muſt be broken, which was made with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> if they did come thither to remove the <hi>Iebuſites.</hi>

               <p>But this is vain and fabulous.</p>
               <p>The true meaning is, that the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> did think their hold ſo ſtrong, that ſo long as there were any men therein, (though blind and lame) they would be able to defend the place againſt <hi>David.</hi>

               <p>We had a faire example hereof in Eighty eight; the invincible Armado of <hi>Spain,</hi> then our enemy, now our reconciled friend, came forth in the ſtrength of ſhips and Ordnance, and men, and promiſed themſelves the conqueſt of this Land: they ſaid we will rejoyce and divide <hi>Sichem,</hi> and meet out the valey of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore our truſt is not in the ſtrength of our dwellings, but God is our rock; on the clifts of this rock we dwell ſafe, ſo that Faith, and not preſumption do build our neaſt.

               <p>Thieves that rob an houſe by night, do not carry away all; and they that gather Crapes neerly, the Law requires to leave ſome cluſters for the poore, the fatherleſſe, and the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
               <p>But in the ſacking of <hi>Edom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 19.10</note> there ſhould be a carrying away of all in ſight, and a curious ſearch for all hidden things; there ſhould be nothing left.</p>
               <p>Neither men nor goods ſhould be concealed, but the eye of ſearch ſhould find them out all.</p>
               <p>There ſhould neither be a ſatiety in their enemies, nor a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; neither fulneſſe, nor pitty ſhould exempt any from ſpoyle.</p>
               <p>That maketh the Prophet ſo patheticall, that he interpoſeth this admiration, <hi>How art thou cut off?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> it is added for an interpretation of this Text,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have made Eſau bare, I have uncovered his ſecret places, and he ſhall not be able to hide himſelf; his ſeed is ſpoiled,</hi>

               <p>This is not to be underſtood ſo as if the Nation and name of <hi>Edom</hi> ſhould ceaſe for ever upon this vaſtation, but for a time; for they were again to build, and were again to pluck down, as <hi>Malachy</hi> prophecyed.</p>
               <p>But in the end there ſhould be nothing left of <hi>Edom,</hi> his very name ſhould be forgotten upon earth even as it is at this day; for who can ſay this is the ſeed of <hi>Eſau?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence. 1. We are taught that where God cometh to the ſpoyle, there is no ſecret and cloſe receptacle, either for the perſons or for the wealth and treaſures of men, but he will ſearch it out and lay it open; their bellies be full of hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, thoſe bellies will he rip up, and into thoſe ſecret parts, ſhall his ſearch penetrate, nothing ſhall be ſafe from it.</p>
               <p>As in the fury of the warres of the Jews, we read that ſome of the Jewes having no other means left to preſerve ſomething to relieve their wans, ſwallowed certain pieces of gold to keep them from the hand of the enemy, which coming to the eares of the Roman ſouldiers, they ript up many of the Jewes bellies to ſeek for gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edom</hi> dwelt in Mount <hi>Seir</hi> amongſt the rocks, and many of

               <p>Thoſe ſearchers of <hi>Edom</hi> be of Gods ſending, and they are his privie ſearch, he will bring to light things hidden in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>Gods ſearch is not like <hi>Labans;</hi> he ſearched all the places but where <hi>Rahel</hi> ſate; but God leaveth no place unſought.</p>
               <p>If the ſecret ſtore eſcape, <hi>fures, perſodiunt &amp; furantur.</hi> Yet there is <hi>tinea &amp; arugo,</hi> the moath and the ruſt, and if nothing elſe, <hi>Tempus edax rerum;</hi> time the conſumer of all things.</p>
               <p>For ſo ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>there is a time to gather, and a time to ſcatter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us not be too much in love with theſe things that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe here; we know that when our <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> began his reigne here over us, all neighbouring and remote Nations of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him peace, and he accepted it, and turned all our ſwords into ſights; I need not ſpeak figuratively.</p>
               <p>Much armour was turned into Utenſils for domeſticall uſes, and then there was no noyſe abroad of hoſtility, even then in the peacefull time of the Church and Common-wealth, the religion of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtirred up certain ſearchers, that digged into the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, and their hunger after Proteſtant bloud, brake
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117695:43"/>through ſtrong walls, and there heaped up ſuch inſtruments of maſſacre, as would have ſearched our hidden things.</p>
               <p>Thoſe theeves would never have had enough, thoſe Grape-gatherers would have left never a cluſter to relieve the poore Church; thy would have rooted up Vine and all, and have laid the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts deſert and waſte.</p>
               <p>Theſe were Papiſts, the miniſters of hell, this was Religion falſely ſo called, the zeale of furies; ſuch theeves lurke in many ſeverall corners of the land; ſuch Grape-gatherers hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the ſhade of our vine; let all that love the peace of <hi>Juruſalem</hi> take heed of them; our houſes, cloſets nay our ſellars are not ſafe from them; they will ſeek out our hidden things, if they can take advantage againſt us.</p>
               <p>Againſt this <hi>Edom</hi> let us bend our forces; and the idolatry and ſuperſtition, and ignorance, and impoſture of that Religion, let us ſearch out and detect.</p>
               <p>It is his Majeſties expreſſe command, that in every pariſh the ſworn men do ſearch for Recuſants, that forſake all our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and for our own malecontent Profeſſors that love any Church better then their own.</p>
               <p>He would ſeparate the clean from the vile, and the peaceable from the factious, <hi>Edom</hi> from <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for we hold nothing in ſafety, we can hide nothing out of ſight, ſo long as thoſe ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and underminers be abroad; the peace and honour and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church is their prey they hunt after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are taught, what a fearfull thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God; when he plucketh his hand out of his boſome, he ſmiteth home, as he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Affliction ſhall not ariſe the ſecond time;</hi> he calleth himſelf in his Law, <hi>a jealous God, his jealouſie burns like fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He can give <hi>Edom</hi> high and ſtrong mountains for his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he can give him the fat of the earth, and the dew of heaven, and let him multiply on the earth exceedingly, he can forbeare him in his wickedneſſe and cruelty for a long time.</p>
               <p>But when he cometh to execute judgment, his right hand will finde out all his enemies, he will not leave a place or corner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearched, <hi>but he will cut off head and taile, branch and root, in one day, for his hand is not ſhortned, but is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then doth the pride of our hearts deceive us flattering us
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117695:44"/>that all ſhall be well with us, though we walk in the luſts of our own hearts; though pride diſguiſe us in our cloathing, though gluttony fill us up to the throats, though drunkenneſſe ſtagger us, and our oaths and blaſphemies fly up as high as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</p>
               <p>Hath God forgotten to be righteous, and is his judgment ſeat turn'd all to mercie, that we dare him with our crying ſins, and awake his vengeance with our abominable impieties?</p>
               <p>Can we ſin the ſins of <hi>Edom,</hi> and not ſmart with their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? he hath a curious and ſearching eye, he hath looked upon our works, he hath ſet our ſins before him, our ſecret ſins in the ſight of his countenance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his eye ſearcheth out the ſins of men then his right hand ſearcheth out all his enemies; <hi>if he be angry, yea but a little, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall ſay one to another, Come and ſee what deſolations he hath made in the earth:</hi> and as it is in my text, <hi>How are they cut off! but peace ſhall be upon Iſrael.</hi>

               <p n="3">3.

                     <item>2. By a compariſon of diſſimilitudes he ſheweth that Thieves and Vine-robbers ſhall be mercifull men in compariſon of them that ſhall fight the Lords battails againſt <hi>Edom.</hi> For they ſhall leave ſomewhat behind them, theſe waſting depopulators of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſhall leave nothing.</item>

                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Which queſtions do put it upon us to take the judgement of God upon <hi>Edom</hi> into a ſerious conſideration.</p>
               <p>It is a queſtion amongſt great learned Divines of former ages
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117695:44"/>which was the greateſt miracle that ever Chriſt wrought whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he lived upon earth.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ierome</hi> anſwereth, ſome thinke the rayſing of <hi>Lazarus:</hi> others the giving ſight to the blind: others the voyce that was heard at his Baptiſm: others his tranſfiguration: but he for his own judgement, he thinks that the whipping of men that bought and ſold in the Temple, twiſe by him performed, was the greateſt of all his miracles.</p>
               <p>For that a man ſo weak in his own perſon, ſo deſpiſed of men, ſo oppoſed by the Merchants of the Temple, ſhould play <hi>Rex</hi> in the Temple, and ſhould there execute judgement, and ſubdue the hearts of ſo many men, who thought they did well, and had ſome colour to defend what they did. And that they ſhould without reſiſtance ſuffer the laſh, and abandon the place.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Origen</hi> doth admire this miracle of his juſtice, as declaring him to be God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith. God is known by executing judgement, <hi>Quo domantur hominum ingenia,</hi> Whereby the wits of men are ſubdued.</p>
               <p>Therefore when the Judgements of God are preached, let men feare. The doctrines of <hi>Paul</hi> were ſoft and gentle, when he ſpake of righteouſneſſe, and temperance; but when he ſpake of the Judgement to come, <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, but it is probably thought, that that laſt doctrine of judgement to come, put him into that quaking and ſhaking fit, and made the earth to quake within him.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> having ſhewed what ſearch God maketh for ſin, addeth,<note place="margin">Pſa. 50.22</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now conſider this, you that forget God leaſt I teare you in pieces and there be none to deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His judgements are over all the earth, it is a meditation for the Sabbath, it is proper for the day.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made me glad through thy worke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 92.4.</note> One of his works is of judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the wicked ſpring as graſſe,</hi>

                  <hi>and when all the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity flouriſh, it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For loe thine enemies O Lord, loe thine enemies ſhall periſh, all the workers of iniquity ſhall be ſcattered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is matter of comfort for the Church of God, it is joy in the tabernacles of the righteous; for they ſay the right hand
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117695:45"/>of the Lord, bringeth mighty things to paſſe.</p>
               <p>It ſerveth alſo to mingle ſome trembling with their joy, and ſome fear with their faith, to keep it from overgrowing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; therefore the Elect of God upon conſideration of the ſevere judgements of God, do feele in themſelves a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed fear of the Majeſty of God, which humbleth them as <hi>Habacuk</hi> confeſſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I heard, my helly trembled, my lights quivered at the voyce, rottenneſſe entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelfe, that I might reſt in the day of trouble.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab 3 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſweet fruit of that conſideration, for it prepareth reſt for the ſoules of them that feare the Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore let fortunes and times delicate minions, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of eaſe, and plenty, which ſtudy nothing but trimme and bravery, and waſt the pretious moments of time, which ſhould be ſpent in the contrite repentance of their ſins, in the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dreſſe of their bodyes,</p>

               <p>Read and ſtudy holy Scriptures; whatſoever is there written, is for our learning; our God is the ſame, and his years fail not; he hath the ſame eye that once he had, to find out ſinners: he hath the ſame hatred that once he had to ſin, he hath the ſame Juſtice that once he had to cenſure it, and the ſame right hand to execute his wrath.</p>

For truſting to their help, whom they found perfidious, they left their habitations, and ſtrong Caſtles empty to keep the enemy from coming upon their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: whilſt their falſe friends expoſe them to invaſion, and their gates to direption, in their abſence. <hi>Relinquentes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they gave their enemies advantage againſt them to keep them from returning again into their ſtrong holds.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:117695:46"/>
               <p n="2">2. They have deceived thee, and prevailed againſt thee. For they that were truſted as friends to <hi>Edom,</hi> betrayed them to their enemies, and fought againſt them, and prevailed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have layed a wound under thee, that is, they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly conveied under thee an inſtrument to wound thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others read <hi>poſuerunt inſidias ſubter te.</hi> Declaring how cunningly their falſe friends had concealed their malice, &amp; how dangerouſly they had layed their plot, for the overthrow of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> ſo neer as under them, even to blow them up. Like our Powder Traytors; for they layed wounds under the Parliament-houſe, inſtruments and means to wound and to deſtroy all.</p>
               <p>And therefore he concludes of <hi>Edom,</hi> There is no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in him, that is <hi>Edom</hi> was blinded, and be fooled with this vain confidence, to truſt in the perfidious friendſhip of their falſe friends.</p>
               <p>From this place theſe Doctrines ariſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was <hi>Edoms</hi> ſin againſt the firſt Commandement to put confidence in man, and therefore God puniſheth them by thoſe whom they truſted. From whence ariſeth this Doctrine,</p>
               <p>That God puniſheth one ſin by another: The ſinne of injury and oppreſſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the ſinne of falſe confidence in men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider againſt whom <hi>Edom</hi> offended, even againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> their brother; for was not <hi>Eſau Iacobs</hi> brother? therefore God puniſheth their perfidiouſneſſe to their brother, with the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe of their friends to them. From whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</p>
               <p>That God requiteth the wicked with the ſame meaſure which they have meated to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas the friends and confederates of <hi>Edom,</hi> turn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Traytors to them, we conclude, that</p>
               <p>There can be no true peace, nor bonds of love between wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From all theſe Antecedents we may conclude, that thoſe who truſt in men, have no underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Doctrine, God puniſheth one ſin by another.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Edom</hi> firſt ſinned againſt the ſecond Table of the Law, in wrong and violence, and then he ſinned in vain confidence in man, againſt the firſt Table, and God by this ſevere ſin puniſhed the firſt.</p>
               <p>It is the manner of Sathan, after a ſpeeding temptation to one ſin, to ſuggeſt another to hide, or to defend and beare up the other, our lying comes in to conceale fraud, as in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo curſing and ſwearing come in to maintain the credit of a lye, as in <hi>Peters</hi> denyall of his Maſter.</p>
               <p>So there needs a great many lyes to maintain one, if interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories do preſſe the Lyer far.</p>
               <p>If it were no more but ſo, that one ſin doth drive us into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, even in this conſideration, one ſin doth puniſh another, becauſe the more ſin is committed, the more puniſhment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but this is much more, that ſinne is puniſhed with ſin.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Edom</hi> firſt breaketh the ſecond Table of the Law, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong to his brother, and fearing that this will one day coſt blows, he ſinneth another ſin againſt the firſt Table, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the confidence in God, and putteth his truſt in men, which turneth to his utter ruine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>So even the Saints of God fall, as <hi>David;</hi> for his adultery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to defile him, and then he ſtained himſelf with the blood of his wel-deſerving and faithful Subject; this is the Plot of <hi>David,</hi> in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why ſin ſhould be the puniſhment of ſin, is becauſe nature being once corrupted, and grace withdrawn, we are, then prone to thoſe defections from God, which do more and more corrupt us. And that is a great puniſhment, S. <hi>Paul</hi> cleerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in the degrees thereof.</p>

               <p>But the union of the faithful is <hi>hujus in hoc,</hi> of this in that. For they be incorporate in one body; and they are made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt and members one of another, one fleſh, one body.</p>
               <p>We ſee men in their greatneſſe followed, and ſerved, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned, obſerved, and preſented, with choiſeſt and richeſt gifts; if we ſee them decline in favour, or power, we ſee them forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their ſervants.</p>
               <p>We ſee young prodigals frequented with company, courted with complements, feaſted and ſwelled with all delights; but when the fountain of this friendſhip is drawn dry, and the means faile, who calleth thoſe men friends, or ſeeketh their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</p>
               <p>This yet appeareth more plainly in the <hi>Idumeans</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that have long perſecuted the true Church of God; for though they have laboured ever ſince the firſt corruption of the Church, to maintain their Hereticall opinions, yet could they never be at any perfect peace amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>And this ofter our Church may boldly make to them, that there is no Tenet in our Religion we maintain againſt them, but we wil renounce it, if we do not find it averred by ſome one, or moſt of eminent learning amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it will take up too much time to give inſtance in al particulars of our difference from the <hi>Trent</hi> Church, For a taſte let me refer ſo many as are deſirous of better ſatisfaction, to read that learned proofe of this truth in the Reverend Dean of <hi>Gloceſters</hi> third book of the Church, at the end of it, where
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117695:50"/>he nameth the agreement of our church with their beſt learned, in points, wherein the Jeſuits at this day accuſe us of Hereſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Therefore one obſerved well, that the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> was like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, the height of it was 60 cubits, and the breadth was but 6; that is without any proportion; for never could they make the parts of it ſymmetricall.</p>
               <p>Therefore, firſt we are comforted againſt all the enemies of our Religion, their ſtrength may be great, and their malice greater; but they cannot unite themſelves with the bond of true Peace, and the God of peace is not their tutelary God.</p>
               <p>In the damnable conſpiracy of the Powder-traytors, God by one of themſelves diverted the Treaſon.</p>
               <p>I deny not but Turks have had many great prevailings againſt Chriſtians, Papiſts againſt Proteſtants, and their confederates have held faſt with them.</p>
               <p>So had <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon, Geball,</hi> the <hi>Aſſirians, Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God found a time to conſume theſe Nations by their own ſtrength, and their own confederates were the ruine of them.</p>
               <p>We have heard that war is one of the ſore judgements wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God ſcourgeth offendors.</p>
               <p>At this time a great part of the Proteſtant Church is hoſtilly attempted with war; we have many of our countrymen, noble, generous, and valiant voluntiers engaged in that cauſe.</p>
               <p>I hope we ſhall do a charitable Chriſtian duty to God and them, to pray God to cover their heads in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, to beſeech him whom <hi>Job</hi> cals the preſerver of men, to ſave them from all evill.

               <p>Another, by deſtroying their perſons, either by his ſore judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by leading into captivity; here both are threatned; for he will deſtroy both <hi>prudentes,</hi> wiſe men, and <hi>prudentiam,</hi> their wiſdome in that day.</p>
               <p>This may remember us of that great day of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>

               <p>For as the day of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the day of <hi>Edom,</hi> and the time of Gods particular judgements is ſet and fixt; ſo is the day of the laſt judgement, in which every man ſhall give an accompt to God of himſelf, and all our works ſhall come to judgement.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Which word as it ſignifieth the coaſt to which the Idumaeans lay from <hi>Jeruſalem: i.e.</hi> the eaſt; ſo it is the name of one of the Nephews of <hi>Eſau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 36.11</note> whoſe poſterity inhabited a part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> called alſo by his name.</p>
               <p>He was the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Eſau;</hi> and under his name here the whole Nation of the Idumaeans is threatned.</p>
               <p>And as the hope the Idumaeans had in the wiſdome of their wiſe men, faileth them, for they have truſted to falſe friends, and all their providence for their ſafety miſcarrieth:</p>
               <p>So ſhall they fail in the hope that they have in their own ſtrong men, for they ſhall not be able to preſerve them from a finall deſtruction, even ſo great that every one of the mount of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhall be cut off by ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>Excellently is their judgment ſet forth; for their confederates ſhall turne perfidious to them abroad, and their ſtrong men at home ſhall be diſmayed.</p>
               <p>Two things make wars advantagable to a Common-wealth, <hi>Conſilium &amp; fortitudo,</hi> counſel and ſtrength: in the former verſe God befools their wiſdome; in this he enfeebles their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, he hath decreed that every one of the mount of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>And when God turneth enemy, neither head nor hand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſdome nor force can reſiſt him; <hi>David</hi> and his ſling ſhall diſcomfit Goliah and his armour, his ſword and ſpear, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The two little flocks of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the great armies of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</p>
               <p>It is worth our noting, that God working by means, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting our operations ſo, even in this work of overthrow threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Edom,</hi> doth deſtroy them by diſabling to them all the meanes of their ſafety, as before he turneth the hearts of their friends againſt them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He deſtroyeth the wiſdome of their wiſe men,</hi> and now he takes away all heart and courage from their ſtrong men.</p>
               <p>To teach us that all the outward means of ſafety are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep us from ruine, <hi>except the Lord be on our ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done.</hi> And we acknowledge,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thine is the Kingdome, power and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this enforceth upon us the law of the firſt Table to have no other gods but one; to give him outward worſhip, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Sabbath, not to abuſe his name.</p>
               <p>And this filleth us with faith, ſaying, <hi>Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem,</hi> I beleeve in God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Domine quis ſimilis tibi,</hi> Lord who is like to thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no wiſdome or ſtrength,</hi> not that which is in the god of this world, the Prince that ruleth in the air, but it is a beame of the heavenly light; can God ſuffer any of his own gifts to be abuſed againſt him, to turn edge and point againſt the author of them?</p>
               <p>There is a time when God winketh at the outrage of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, for the exerciſing of the patience of his ſervants; but when he intendeth a cutting off by ſlaughter of his enemies, in that day the Lord will be known to be God.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are written for our ſakes; for the enemies of our Church are here threatned to be cut off by ſlaughter, even Antichriſt the man of ſin, who ſitteth in the place of God as God, and is worſhipped, whom God ſhall ſcatter with the breath of his mouth, that is, by the power of his word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and we have comfort againſt him, that neither his wit nor his force ſhall prevaile againſt us.</p>
               <p>We have two examples which I hope no time will ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to praiſe God for, till the ſecond coming of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The power of Antichriſt was defeated in 88. when the Pope gave away the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King of Spaine, who ſent his <hi>Invincible Armado</hi> hither, not as a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger, but as a Conquerer to take poſſeſſion of theſe Lands.</p>
               <p>They had ſpeciall revelations to aſſure their victory, and the prayers of the Popiſh Church were all in armes againſt us.</p>
               <p>But as it is in my text, <hi>their mighty men were diſmayed,</hi> their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117695:56"/>ſtrong Ships either ſunk in the ſea, or well beaten, or conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to flie, becauſe God meant to cut them off by ſlaughter, and the power of Spaine ſo weakned, and the coffers of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo emptied, that nothing was more welcome to them then the newes of peace with <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wiſdome of <hi>Rome</hi> had no better ſucceſſe in the yeere 1605. for when ſome men of bloud, the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> had layed a plot for the deſtruction of the whole Church and Common-wealth then in Parliament, by powder:</p>
               <p>We cannot deny but the Serpent put his beſt wits to the rack, to ſtamp a deviſe with his own image and ſuperſcription; never was there <hi>nequitia ingenioſior,</hi> a more witty wickedneſſe, then to bring ſo many precious lives to the mercie of one excutioner who had nothing to do but to put fire to the train.</p>
               <p>Yet in the very act of preparation, and the night before the intended execution, God put fire to his own train layed for them, and diſcovered things hidden in darkneſſe, and caſt them into the pit which he had digged for them; and their wit and policie proved hanging and quartering to the conſpirators; and declared the Papiſt our ſecret enemies, ſuch whom we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look to; for if by ſtrength or wit he can deſtroy the ſtate of the Church and Common-wealth, the mercies of his heart are ſo cruell, that we can expect no favour.</p>
               <p>That is now the cauſe why his Majeſty intending a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth require ſo ſtrict a ſurvey of the land for the detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Popiſh Recuſants, as now is both by the Eccleſiaſticall and Civill Magiſtrate urged.</p>
               <p>For they have given us fair warning, that if they can do any thing by wit or force, they will abate nothing thereof to the prejudice of this Church. But as the confounding of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Edom,</hi> and the diſabling the ſtrength of <hi>Edom</hi> did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run their fall: ſo our faith is, that Antichriſt, Gods enemy and ours, hath now but a ſhort time; and every one of the mount of <hi>Eſau</hi> of the City built upon the hills ſhall be cut off by ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The pride of their own hearts, who think they have the keyes of heaven and of hell: not only <hi>Peters</hi> keyes, but <hi>Davids</hi> alſo; who bear the world in hand, that they can ſave or condemn, ſhall deceive them.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:117695:56"/>
               <p>The rock of their habitation ſhall prove to them like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defenced City.</p>
               <p>Their confederates, and men of their peace, that eat bread with them, ſhall turn edge againſt them.</p>
               <p>Their wiſe men ſhall fail them, and their Triple-crown and the temporall power of their Hierarchy ſhall be diſabled; we have the word of God for it, <hi>The man of ſin muſt be deſtroyed. Even ſo let all thine enemies periſh O Lord.</hi> Amen Amen.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We ſummed up the particulars, and finde that God had juſt cauſe to enter into judgement with <hi>Edom,</hi> and to execute upon them his fierce wrath.</p>
               <p>The ſinne was breach of the Law, and a treſpaſſe againſt the ſecond Table; againſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is the poſterity of <hi>Iacob</hi> their brother.</p>
               <p>And here I note that eſpecially two Commandements of the ſecond Table are broken.</p>

               <p>For what part of their cruelty toucheth the life of <hi>Jacob,</hi> is a breach of the Firſt.</p>
               <p>What toucheth his eſtate, and goods, is a breach of the latter Commandement.</p>
               <p>And this example may ſerve for a Commentary upon thoſe two Commandements, teaching how they are broken; for <hi>Edom</hi> is a very full example of tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the cruelty of combination, they that joyne with others that ſeek the life of man, are murtherers, not acceſſaries, but principals; ſo did <hi>Edom,</hi> for he was even as they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul,</hi> after <hi>Paul,</hi> a bleſſed Apoſtle, doth charge the murther of <hi>Stephen</hi> upon himſelfe, becauſe as here, he was of the other
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117695:58"/>ſide, and ſate by and kept the clothes of them that ſtoned him.</p>
               <p>It is a fleſhing of men in cruelty to aſſociate in blood, and to communicate with the blood-thirſty; we ſee it after in <hi>Saul,</hi> he was a principall Actor, and got Commiſſion to perſecute and went about breathing threatnings againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>And as it is in the Law of Murther, ſo it is in the Law of Theft; for every aſſociation with Theeves, and Robbers, is the breach of that Commandement, and <hi>Edom</hi> brake both theſe Laws, for they were even as they that robbed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſought their life, though they commenced not the war againſt their brother <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> yet they joyned wit them that did, and ſo they are <hi>pares culpa,</hi> alike in fault.</p>

               <p>Far be it them from us, who carry the names of Chriſtians to rejoyce at the ſufferings of our brethren, for this is murther; Let <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians teach Turks and Indians, and Maſſagets to be barbarous, let their mercies be cruel: for ſo would they have joyed if their Powder-Treaſon had ſped.</p>

               <p>The puniſhment of ſin is the joy, but the deſtruction of the perſon of the ſinner is the griefe of all them that feare God.</p>
               <p>The heart is a Principall in murther; for out of the heart cometh murther, and an evil eye to look upon it.</p>
               <p>It proceedeth from a corrupt and cruel heart, when we paſſe by and regard not the afflictions of our brethren to relieve them, as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> did, but when we rejoyce over them as <hi>Edom</hi> here did, and make our ſelves merry with their ſins, or their puniſhments, our hearts are murtherers of our brethren; and when he cometh that will one day make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for blood, <hi>he will remember the complaint of the poore.</hi>

               <p>The joy that the Jewes had at the death of Chriſt, what ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hath it coſt them ever ſince? they have gone like <hi>Cain</hi> with a mark upon them, ſtigmatized and branded as murtherers, and they are ſcattered upon the face of the earth; 1600 yeers almoſt

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This ground being layed, theſe concluſions do reſult concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That no man ought to rejoyce at the ruine and deſtruction of a man, as he is a man; for this is a naturall tye that bindeth us one to another, and Religion doth not unbind the bonds of nature; rather it is <hi>religatio,</hi> and tyeth them much faſter.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, for though the Image of God in which man was created were much defaced in the fall of man, yet was it not wholly extinguiſhed, for the image of the Trinity is an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character, it cannot be wholly loſt, not in the reprobate, I may adde not in the damned, for even they alſo are the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore as they are the creatures of God, we do owe them love and pity, in honour of the Image of God in them, and ought not rejoyce to to ſee the blemiſhes of Gods Image.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Samaritane</hi> ſhewed kindneſſe to the Jew that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Theeves, although as the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid, <hi>they converſe not together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> curſed the cruel furie of his ſonnes, for deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> though Aliens from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and uſurping their land.</p>
               <p>And ſo God hating both the <hi>Moabite</hi> and the <hi>Edomite,</hi> yet he avenged the cauſe of them, againſt the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Moab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and for foure, I will not turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the puniſhment thereof, becauſe he burnt the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I will ſend a fire upon Moab, and it ſhall devoure the Palaces of Kerioth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to go lower, when the rich man in hell-fire ſaw <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and beſought him for helpe, he anſwered him by that loving compellation; <hi>Son thou in thy life time, &amp;c.</hi> hell would not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:117695:62"/>take that from him but that he was <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonne according to the fleſh.</p>
               <p>And whilſt we live here we ought much rather to doe all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of humanity to our enemies, becauſe they are men, and becauſe only God knoweth who are his, and they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and come into the Vineyard at the laſt houre.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As they are enemies;</p>
               <p n="1">1 We conſider them as Gods enemies, ſo we hate them, not their perſons, but their vices, for that as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defineth, it is <hi>odium perfectum,</hi> a perfect hatred; and indeed it is the hatred that God beareth to his enemies; <hi>For the wrath of God from heaven is revealed againſt the unrighteouſneſſe and ungodlineſſe of men,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their perſons, they are his workmanſhip, and carry his Image in ſome ſort, though much disfigured, but againſt the unrighteouſneſſe and ungodlineſſe of men, by which their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do ſtand obnoxious to his diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>And thus I find the Saints of God have inſulted over the wicked, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> over <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Gileadites</hi> over the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon,</hi>

               <p>Thus then it is lawfull, when God hath executed his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his enemies for all the friends of God to inſult over them, and to lift up their voice and hand againſt them; for this is part of the puniſhment of Gods enemies, they that deſpiſe me ſhall be deſpiſed.</p>

               <p>This fact of <hi>Abraham,</hi> thus bleſſed by <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> thus proſpered by God himſelfe, doth declare the ſubjection of theſe Kingdomes to <hi>Chedarlaomer,</hi> to have been oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and their Rebellion a juſt proſecution of their liberty; and therefore the war of <hi>Abraham</hi> a juſt war.</p>

               <p>This was no new Hereſie, but a reviving of the old, of them that called themſelves <hi>Apoſtolici,</hi> mentioned by Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Haereſ 40.</note> who in imitation of the Apoſtles, would have all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>True, that in thoſe beginnings of Chriſts Church, when the number of Chriſtians were yet but ſmall, it was a voluntary, not a compulſary communication of goods that was then, and for a ſmall time uſed, as a fortifying of themſelves againſt the common adverſary.</p>
               <p>But there was no Law but of their own piety and charity that did impoſe this as a duty upon them; ſo that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were not puniſhed with ſudden death for detaining a part of the price of the field which they ſold, for they might have with-held all: but they were puniſhed for lying to the Holy Ghoſt, bringing but a part, and affirming that they brought all.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias, After it was ſold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 5.4.</note>

               <p>Yet in that communication it was not lawfull for every man to take what he would;<note place="margin">Acts 5 35.</note> but the Apoſtles <hi>diſtributed to every one according to their need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely if <hi>Edom</hi> and the Chaldeans had had as good right to the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to the goods therein as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, God had not laid this for an evidence againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> that he laid hand on their ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>God is Lord of all, and he hath given the earth to the ſons of men, yet not in common, nor in equall diſtribution.</p>

               <p>And there be two vertues commended in holy Scripture which make men Proprietaries in the things of this world, that is,</p>

                  <hi>Juſtitia qua ſuum cuique tribuis,</hi> Juſtice whereby thou giveſt to every one his own.</p>

               <p>The Uſe of this point is, Let every one know his own, and not lay hand on the ſubſtance of his brother;<note place="margin">Eph 4 28.</note> 
                  <hi>and let him that ſtole, ſteale no more, but let him labour,</hi> not all for himſelf, but <hi>that he may give to him that needeth:</hi> that the poore may grow up with him, as he did with <hi>Job,</hi> and that none periſh for want of meat and cloathing.</p>
               <p>Godlineſſe muſt be joyned with contentment, the law doth not only bind the hand, <hi>non furaberis,</hi> thou ſhalt not ſteal; but it bindeth the heart too, <hi>non concupiſces,</hi> thou ſhalt not cover, not his houſe, not his ground, not his wife, not his ſervant, not any thing of his.</p>
               <p>There be many wayes of theft, I am limited to that of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent taking away of our neighburs ſubſtance, for that only is here named and judged, and that is either directly by invaſion, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly practiſed by oppreſſion.</p>

               <p>The time of <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> chaſtiſement was called the day of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> becauſe their ſins deſerved that day to come upon them; but the day of the heathen is here called the day of the Lord, becauſe now God doth, <hi>awake, as one out of ſleepe, and ſheweth himſelfe cleerly to his enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This day the Prophet telleth them is now at hand, and neere to them.</p>
               <p>This is neere upon all the heathen.</p>
               <p>Not only upon <hi>Edom,</hi> but upon all thoſe with whom <hi>Edom</hi> joyned himſelfe againſt the people of God.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> foretelling this day,<note place="margin">Jer. 25.</note> nameth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon whom the wrath of the Lord was to come.</p>
               <p>And the judgement is, <hi>eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Lex tali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> wherein he telleth her, <hi>As thou haſt done, it ſhall be done to thee, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And after Metaphorically he expreſſeth the retaliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As thou haſt drunk upon my holy mountain;</hi> hereof we obſerve, the change of the manner of ſpeech that is here uſed; we ſhall cleere the Text from that difficulty that hath diſtracted inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, ſo that they have failed in the right meaning of theſe words.</p>
               <p>For whereas before the Prophet ſpeaketh to <hi>Edom,</hi> here he bringeth in God himſelfe ſpeaking to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> comforting them, in the declaration of his juſt judgement againſt her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for he ſaith to <hi>Iacob,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As thou haſt drunk upon my holy mountains, ſo ſhall all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then drink continually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Metaphor of drinking, which is referred to that which is called the cup of the Lords indignation, of which <hi>David</hi> ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, the Wine is red, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this figure then, the cup of affliction is underſtood: the phraſe was uſed after by our Saviour, <hi>Let this cup paſſe from me;</hi> again, <hi>If thou wilt not let it paſſe but that I muſt drink thereof, thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We uſe that phraſe to drink of the cup of God. So the threatning runneth in this ſenſe that as the people of God upon Gods holy mountaine have drunk of the cup of Gods wrath, and have had their draught thereof, which was but for a time: <hi>So ſhall all the heathen drinke, and their judgement ſhall not have end: they ſhall drink continually, there ſhall be no end of their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: they ſhall ſwallow down the wrath of the Lord, untill they be utterly deſtroyed, for they ſhall be as though they had not been.</hi>

               <p>The Lord hath ſet down and decreed a day for vengeance; threatnings of woe at large do move but little, but when the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is denounced, and the day ſet for the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, this cannot but pierce and draw blood. And being here called <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> that is, a day deſigned by the Lord for this execution, it is more quick and penetrating.</p>
               <p>There is no ſin which is committed on earth, but God hath both made a Law againſt it to forbid the doing of it, and he hath declared his judgement againſt it; yet hath he given us the light of his word, or the light of the Law, which his finger wrote in our hearts, to declare it to us, and he hath given us time alſo to repent and amend it, and he is patient and long-ſuffering in his expectation of our amendment.</p>
               <p>But where it is not amended, he doth ſet down a day for the execution of his juſt judgement, for he will not, he cannot ſuffer <hi>his truth to faile,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His patience and mercy will take their day firſt, and his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will alſo have her day.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> advertizeth us,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let patience have her perfect work.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We have a faire example of God for this; For he will not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:117695:69"/>let the work of his patience be unperfect, he will forbear us till the very day of his juſtice deſigned for puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Though all the maſters of Aſſemblies, all the Miniſters of the word be continually ſtriking at this naile, we cannot drive it into the head; to make men beleeve that God hath ſet a day for puniſhment of all our ſins.</p>
               <p>The promiſe of grace to the penitent doth ſo comfort us ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that we hope we ſhall have time enough to put off that day by our repentance; and then again we often take that for repentance which is not it. For it is not enough to remember our ſins with a God forgive me; Repentance is a putting off of ſinne, an hatred of it, and a change of life and manners; every ſorrow is not ſuch.</p>
               <p>But were it that this day were thought upon with that feare and trembling that is due to it; it would put ſin out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the ſinner out of hope.</p>
               <p>The ſinner that beleeves not this, doth make God a lyar, whoſe word of truth hath revealed the certainty of this day to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It armeth the luſts of the fleſh againſt the ſoule; for who is he that liveth without fear, that will bridle his affections, or ſtop the ſwift current of nature in himſelf, but runneth into ſinne as an horſe ruſheth into the battaile.</p>
               <p>But when we do conſider upon every ſin that we commit, that the day of the Lord ſhall declare it, the day of the Lord ſhall puniſh it; this maketh us afraid of our ſecret ſins for feare of ſhame, and of all ſins for feare of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The certainty that this day will come, the uncertainty when it will come, is the greateſt motive to haſten repentance, that may be.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If our Conſciences be convinced of the certainty of this day, and the judgement thereof; Sathans next alluſion is to flatter us that it is afarre off, and ſhall not come yet, and there will be time enough to repent us of our ſin.</p>
               <p>If we tell you indefinitely that it is neere, yet you may hope not ſo neere but that we may prevent it.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle hath told his brethren long-agoe, of the laſt

               <p>But let not that comfort thee in ſin; for even that day is neer, ſeeing time is nothing to eternity; but thy day wherein God ſhall viſit thy ſinnes with his judgements, may be much ſooner.</p>
               <p>If we had Commiſſion to tell you it is but forty dayes, and the next day is the day of the Lord as <hi>Jonah</hi> did; peradventure it would warn you; but we have no Commiſſion to ſay it is ſo; it is a good proofe that it is neere, when none can promiſe that this very day ſhall not be it.</p>

               <p>Therefore the word of God is not ſent in the Miniſtry of his ſervants to convert reprobates; that cannot be, they cannot be converted; and if God had revealed to us whom he hateth, we might ſave a labour of preaching to them in hope of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>But the uſe of preaching and prayer is, for ſuch as are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Church, <hi>to confirme the brethren,</hi> and to build them up further for thoſe ſheep which are without, to bring them to the fold; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he hath other ſheep which are not yet of his fold,</hi> and them he muſt bring to it.</p>
               <p>And when you read of ſo many added to the Church, it was not out of the number of reprobates, but out of the number of Gods choſen, who were before uncalled.</p>
               <p>This is a ſecret which God concealeth within the cloſet of his own wiſdome; <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the elect of God reſt in this: if the wicked of the earth that live in all kind of ungodlineſſe be in the decree of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they cannot miſcarry, though they hold out as the thiefe did, till they come to the croſſe to die.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us deſpaire of no mans ſalvation amongſt us.</p>
               <p>But if the decree of Gods hatred be ſetled upon them, there is no hope; for Chriſt the remedy of ſin undertaketh for no more then the Father hath given to him.</p>
               <p>Theſe howſoever they proſper on earth in things temporall, they have drank a draught of deadly wine, that ever riſeth up in them, and upbraideth them; for God hath ſpoken, it. <hi>Nulla pax impio,</hi> there is no peace to the wicked.</p>

               <p>The illuſion that deceiveth them is this:</p>

                  <hi>Non credendum eſt tunc amiſſuros ſanctos viſcera miſericordiae, cum fuerint pleniſſimae ac perfectiſſimae ſanctitatis: at qui tunc orabant pro inimicis, quando ipſi ſine peccato non erant, tunc non orent pro ſupplicibus ſuis, quando nullum caeperint habere pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is further urged,</p>
               <p>For when we ſay the Scripture doth tell us that God will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly puniſh the wicked; and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He will not ſuffer his truth to faile;</hi>

                  <hi>And it ſhall be in that day that living waters ſhall go out from Ieruſalem.</hi>

               <p>And at the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, it was not as here is ſaid, <hi>Nor day, nor night,</hi> for then <hi>Lux magna orta eſt:</hi> the ſunne of righteouſneſſe aroſe in our hemiſphere, the very night was lighted to the ſhepherds with an extraordinary cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

               <p>Therefore, I conclude that this prophecy is to be fulfilled towards the end of the world, when God ſhall call againe his people from far, and his diſperſed from the ends of the earth.</p>
               <p>When the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is come in, then ſhall God call again his people, <hi>and remember the oath that he ſware unto Abraham, and the ſure mercies of David.</hi> Then ſhall he ſet his name again in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and diſplant the intruders upon his poſſeſſion, and ſettle his habitation once again upon the Holy mountain at the end of the world.</p>

               <p>But God is ſaid to ſanctifie ſome places here on earth, becauſe he is preſent there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the place which God took into his ſpeciall protection, and where he placed his ſpeciall worſhip; <hi>for the Lord God was well known in Sion; at Salem was his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. And for the ſpeciall care that he had of that place, <hi>He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the gates of Sion more, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>Spiritualis cura,</hi> Spiritual care, ſo ſanctified that place that when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had polluted the worſhip of God, and Heathen came in upon Gods inheritance, and defiled his Sanctuary, yet ceaſed not that place to be Holy; not by any inherent holineſſe as the Roman Church ſuggeſteth, but only <hi>ſecundum ſpecialem
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:117695:81"/>curam,</hi> becauſe it was not yet out of Gods ſpeciall protection; and only thus it is holy at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Propter ſpecialem cultum,</hi> for his ſpeciall worſhip; when any place is dedicate to Gods worſhip, and ſeparate from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, it is an holy place, and God vouchſafeth there <hi>ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem praeſentiam,</hi> a ſpecial preſence. For I am not of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> mind who ſaith, <hi>Templa non ſunt propria Dei habitacula, unde aurem propius admoveat.</hi> For God hath a ſpeciall intereſt in thoſe places which are ſeparate to his ſpecial worſhip, and the very place is fearful to them that have any ſenſe of Religion; and as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaith, <hi>plus participat gratiae &amp; operationis Dei,</hi> they partake more of the powerfull operation of God.</p>
               <p>For why is Heaven the Throne of God more then the earth, but becauſe God doth there more expreſſe his glory, then he doth here.</p>
               <p>And for the intereſt that God hath in thoſe conſecrated pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, conſider Gods challenge in my Text, Sion though in the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> is the Mount of God.</p>
               <p>Churches and Lands once given to God, do remain his for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for unleſſe God ſhall manifeſtly reveale his reſignation to man, what man on earth hath any aſſignment from him of his right.</p>
               <p>Beloved, we have power to give to God of his own, but we have no power on earth for revocation, when it is once Sacred, and God hath encloſed it, no man can lay it common.</p>
               <p>But the fat of the Church hath fed ſo many of all degrees in this Land to that grouth and ſtrength, that this Doctrine is a Paradox, and we are but laught at when we plead the right of God to things ſacred.</p>
               <p>For if Sacriledge be a ſinne, what rank of men in this or our neighbour kingdome doth not live in ſin and by ſin?</p>
               <p>The Mount of Sion is challenged here to be the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of God, in whoſe hand ſoever the poſſeſſion thereof be, and all that invade the right of God in things ſacred ſhall heare him complain,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye have robbed me;</hi> and though they make it ſtrange, and aske <hi>wherin have we robbed thee? Solomon</hi> will tell them, <hi>It is a ſnare for a man to devoure that which is Sanctified, and after the vowes to enquire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a great favour of God to his Church to reveal to them
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117695:81"/>his will concerning both their own ſhort puniſhment, and the long affliction of their enemies.</p>
               <p>For themſelves, they ſhall ſee in this revelation, that God wil not give then over utterly; and affliction doth never ſhew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable when we can look beyond it, and ſee faire weather after it.</p>
               <p>This had need be preached to the Church of God, to keep them from fainting in their patience, from falling into ſin.</p>

               <p>The Prophet having given us his own example, doth alſo give us his good counſell;</p>

               </p>
               <p>You ſee the uſe of this doctrine is to put mettle into us that we be not caſt down with the preſent ſenſe of Gods judgement, but that we couragiouſly do beare them, and patiently expect our deliverance from them. Of this before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a comfort and joy, to the Church to know that God will execute their judgements upon their enemies, and paſſe the cup of his wrath from them to thoſe that hate them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe it ſtoppeth the way to an high and grievous ſinne, which is murmuring againſt God; let every man ſuſpect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for this; for Gods own <hi>Iſrael</hi> did often fall this way; But when God revealeth to us his purpoſe we cannot find fault: though we feel where judgment beginneth we know where it ſhall end.</item>
                  <item>2. It allayeth all thoughts of revenge on them that trouble and perſecute us; for to what purpoſe ſhould we fret our ſelves at the inſtruments of Gods vengeance, when we know the end of theſe men, how <hi>God hath ſet them in ſlippery places, and that he will take the matter into his own hand to revenge it?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And this is a neceſſary Doctrine for us, becauſe the purſuit of private revenge is one of the crying ſins of the time. We have poore men that to moleſt a neighbour will ſwear the peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to put them in bonds; when it is to be feared that it is rather revenge then feare that makes them ſweare, and this upon a little cooling of blood appears cleerly.</p>
               <p>Juſt Laws are made to do men right againſt wrongs; we muſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117695:82"/>go to Judges as children to their Father, to ſeeke Juſtice in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not in the ſpirit of revenge. God hath declared himſelfe to be <hi>Deus ultionum</hi> a God of revenge, and hath promiſed to judge our cauſe; let us commit the matter to him, and give our ſouls reſt poſſeſſing them with patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall ſee their cup that they have but taſted, drunk up and ſwallowed down of their enemies: <hi>the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mine eye ſhall ſee my deſire upon mine enemies.</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe mine enemy doth not triumph over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is a good ſigne of Gods love to his Church, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not the ungodly to inſult over them.</p>
               <p>And for the enemies of the Church, they may have victory, they cannot have a triumph; for the cup of wrath is no ſooner taken from the Church, but it is preſently given to her enemies to pledge them, as the Prophet ſaith:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When thou haſt done ſpoyling, thou ſhalt be ſpoyled, the drinke ſhall not pall in the cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee that <hi>David</hi> made that uſe of the fall and puniſhment of his enemy, only to rejoyce in the Lord, and his favour, and not to inſult over his enemy; for the wiſe man adviſeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 24.17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>and let not thine heart be glad when he ſtumbleth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt the Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and he turne away his wrath from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thy patience doth heap coales of fire on the head of thine enemy; and thy favourable forbearance of him, in triumphing over him, holdeth the cup ſtill to his mouth.</p>
               <p>We cannot do our enemy a greater pleaſure, then to be glad at his afflictions, for God ſeeth it and abateth his diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but we may rejoyce ſafely and boldly in the love and favour of God to us.</p>

               <p>Mount <hi>Sion</hi> literally doth ſignifie the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the whole Nation of the Jewes; taking name from the moſt eminent part of their Kingdome, as Mount <hi>Sion</hi> denoteth <hi>Eſau</hi> and his iſſue; this ſhall be delivered from the captivity of <hi>Babilon;</hi> that is the deliverance here promiſed.</p>
               <p>And the holines here mentioned, is the renewing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by repentance and new obedience to the pure worſhip of God; and then the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall recover the poſſeſſions which the army of the Chaldeans took from them.</p>
               <p>Allegorically and typically, this Prophecy doth foretell the deliverance of the Church from all the enemies thereof in the end of the world, which ſhall be performed by the ſpirit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification fitting them to the ſame.</p>
               <p>That the Church ſhall not alway be under the rod of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we have formerly declared.</p>
               <list>

                  <hi>ſurely to do juſtice, and to love mercie, and to humble thy ſelfe to walk with thy God,</hi> this is holineſſe.</p>
               <p>This is no earthly wiſdome, <hi>which is carnall, ſenſuall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh;</hi> it is the <hi>wiſdome which is from above,</hi> and therefore, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holineſſe is not learned in the Schoole of nature, nor to be ſeen by the light of reaſon; it is the inward light of the ſpirit of God that enlightneth our darkneſſe, which openeth to man the way of good life, not morall and civill only, but religious and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117695:83"/>ſpiritual, which teacheth juſtice mingled with mercie, both built upon a good foundation of humility, and theſe not as before men, but as in a walk with God himſelf.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as theſe God keepeth a book of remembrance as the Prophet ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another,</hi>

               <p>What can a man deſire more of God, then to be eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his jewels and precious treaſure? ſuch are the holy? and what trouble can it be to them to be deſpiſed of the world, and caſt out of them, when God ſhall take them in as his jewels and treaſure? God himſelf giveth holineſſe in precept, and giveth the reaſon in that injunction, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>that every man that hath hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So that Gods holineſſe is the motive that muſt induce us, and the preſident and pattern that muſt conduce us to holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The motive, becauſe he being holy; nothing ungodly and unclean may approach him, therefore all the legall purifications and ſanctifyings of the poople, before any ſpeciall worſhip and ſervice of God, were types of that holineſſe which muſt fit us for Gods ſervice; becauſe <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God.</hi>

               <p>Again becauſe the favours which we deſire from God be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Nolite dare quod ſanctum eſt canibus,</hi> give not that which is holy to dogs; ſurely he will not do ſo himſelf.</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:117695:83"/>proceeding from holineſſe in the heart and inward affections: holineſſe of the tongue, that it ſpeak not lewdly, falſely, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely; holineſſe of operation, that we do nothing but what becometh the Saints of God. Holineſſe at Church, and holines at home; holineſſe in our private converſations, and in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate retirings, that is in the whole man, in the whole time of his life, and in all places.</item>
                  <item>3. That it be guided with knowledge, for the ignorant holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is implicit, and knoweth not what it doth, <hi>is the ſacrifice of fools:</hi> like the Athenians worſhip directed to an unknown God.</item>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:117695:88"/>of peace, and it is good for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be afflicted to come to his.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Church here was the better for this affliction that they ſuſtained, even in their temporall eſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the reſtitution of their poſſeſſions; for it is a rule of truth, though it ſhew a very great imperfection in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as great corrupion in our affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carendo magis quam fruendo,</hi> by waiting, rather then by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, we come to know the true worth of Gods ſavours.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>carendo</hi> by wanting, not ſo much in an <hi>ante</hi>-want, as in a <hi>poſt</hi>-want.</p>
               <p>In an <hi>Ante</hi>-want, when we riſe from poverty to wealth, from baſeneſſe to honour, from labour to eaſe: commonly as our good, ſo our bloud ariſeth; and it is a great grace of God, if the riſing of our fortunes, be not the ſinking and falling of our faith and obedience to God; For many in low eſtate have been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe pride in high eſtate have been importable: many in poverty have had tender hearts, who in wealth have turned great oppreſſours of their brethren; and many in labour have been content with a little, who in eaſe have growne reſty and idle.</p>
               <p>But in a <hi>poſt</hi>-want, when men fall from wealth to poverty, from honour to the duſt, from eaſe to labour, then they can look back, and recompt the ſweetneſſe of theſe outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> hath two whole Chapters,</p>
               <p>In one he confeſſeth his former eſtate, the fulneſſe, and the power, and the eaſe, and the glory thereof, he beginnes it with an <hi>optative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O that</hi> I <hi>were as in monthes paſt, as in the dayes when God preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When his candle ſhined upon my head, when by his light</hi> I <hi>walked through darknes as</hi> I <hi>was in the dayes of my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Few of us in health do feel the favour of God to us therein: few in wealth do taſte the ſweetneſſe of Gods open and giving hand: few content with their portion.</p>
               <p>But in ſickneſſe every little mittigation of our paine, is ſweet, and we are ready to fall on our knees before God to thanke him for it.</p>
               <p>In poverty, every almes given to us, thankfully received, and then if we were as in monthes paſt, how much better would we uſe wealth.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:117695:89"/>
               <p>For <hi>Job</hi> in the next Chapter doth feel the change, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bitterneſſe in it,<note place="margin">Job 30.</note> and he endeth that Chapter: <hi>My harpe is turned into mourning, and my Organs into the voice of them that weed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, when we once come to want that which we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have poſſeſt, we whoſe ambitious deſires gave us no reſt, either to be thankfull for that we had, or content with it, would deſire no more then to be as in ſome monthes before, that God would but light that candle againe, and reſtore us to what we have loſt.</p>
               <p>As in the ſpirituall ſtate of the ſoule, <hi>David</hi> that neglected the day of his ſalvation, which God gave him before his fall, and ſold it for a little carnall pleaſure; when he came againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he only prayes,</p>
               <q>Reſtore to me the joy of thy Salvation.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.7.</note>
               </q>
               <p>And the Church revolting from God, remembreth her ſelfe, and ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will go and returne to my firſt husband, for then was it better with me then now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is a great favour of God to his people, to reſtore them their owne poſſeſſions againe, that they may be as in yeares paſt: for now they having wanted them, do better know the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God then they did before in the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>They would have eſteemed it a greater favour in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, to have had but ſome eaſe of their burthens, ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y to have eaten the fruites of their labours, in great miſeries every little breathing of eaſe is ſweet and comfortable: but here is a full reſtitution of them to their former poſſeſſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But here is much more promiſed, even dilatation of their borders, they ſhall have more then they had, they may call their place <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> called the Well when he had room to dig in.<note place="margin">Gen. 26.21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord hath an open and a filling hand, even in this alſo, <hi>Multiplicat benefacere,</hi> here is <hi>Copioſa redemptio, copioſa reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as it is another degree of favour to riſe from reſtitution to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:117695:89"/>dilatation: ſo it may ſtand for a degree, that he enlargeth their bounds out of the poſſeſſion of their enemies, and giveth away their Land to his people.</p>
               <p>Let no man charge God with injuſtice herein; for <hi>The earth is the Lords, and all that therein is;</hi> he giveth it where he will.</p>
               <p>And Jeſus Chriſt his Son, hath promiſed the meek the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the earth; for by right none but the Elect are true ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth; the ungodly are but intruders and uſurpers thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus much added to their owne to make them more territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thus much taken from their neighbouring enemies the Edomites and the Philiſtims, and given to them, makes them gainers by their loſſe: their baniſhment was a ſowing in teares, this is a reaping in joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> was ſo reaſonable, that he only deſired of God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make us glad according to the dayes wherein thou haſt afflicted us, and the yeers wherein we have ſeen evill.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 90.15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>God is a more bountifull giver, for he maketh his people glad; not only with that which they loſt, but with much more; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſheth their enemies to enrich them, that they may take the labours of the people into their poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> would have wiſht no more then to be as he was in ſome months paſt,<note place="margin">Job v 2.10.</note> and God not only reſtoreth him what he formerly had, but he giveth him twiſe ſo much as he had before:</p>
               <p>

               <p>For in things temporal this doth not alwayes hold, that God repaireth thus the loſſes of his children, neither do they expect it for they have learned how to want; but what wanteth in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, is reſtored to them in ſpirituall graces; in the gifts of patience and contentedneſſe, in thankfulneſſe, and the ſpirit of ſupplications.</p>

               <p>The reaſon of this happy end of the labours and ſorrows of the Church is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the narrow way to glory may be frequented; for who would put himſelfe to the rugged ſeverity of a ſtrict life, into the hatred of the world, to make himſelfe as the way of the ſtreet for the proud to go over him; if he did not perſwade himſelfe, <hi>that his heavines ſhould endure but for a night, and that he ſhould have joy in the morning?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this is that ſame, <hi>Carmen in nocte,</hi> Song in the night that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of; <hi>Laetitia in tribulatione,</hi> joy in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus doth God comfort the Church often by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way either perfidious and unſound friends, that live in the Church to betray it: or by removing corrupt and bribing retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of preferments in Church and Common-wealth: or by committing of cruel and unmercifull oppreſſions of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as bad at the task-maſters of <hi>Egypt</hi> to lay b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
